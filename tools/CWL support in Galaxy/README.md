ELIXIR Implementation Study: Enabling the reuse, extension, scaling, and reproducibility of scientific workflows

## Leads

- Hervé Ménager
- Michael R. Crusoe
- John Chilton 

## Background information
---
The field of bioinformatics has seen increasing use of the Common Workflow Language (CWL) to describe systematically the entirety of an informatics pipeline. Within the Marine Metagenomics Use Case, various annotation pipelines are already described in CWL.  The Workflow Implementation Study aims to demonstrate how such CWL tool descriptions can be reused, together with additional tool descriptions, to produce extended and new analysis workflows, namely the assembly and functional annotation of transcriptomes from isolated marine eukaryotes.  Part of this implementation study is to contribute to the ongoing effort for the native support for CWL execution within Galaxy. 

## Expected outcomes
---

Improved support for CWL in Galaxy, building on the initial work by the CWL Community and John Chilton for the Galaxy community, with the goal to improve the native support for CWL in Galaxy.

## Expected audience
---

Software developers with either Python or Frontend development skills (especially Javascript), with or without an initial experience of development in Galaxy and/or CWL.
**Expected hacking days**: 4 days
