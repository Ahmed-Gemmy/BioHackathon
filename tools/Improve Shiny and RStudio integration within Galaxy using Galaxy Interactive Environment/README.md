## Background information
---
Shiny (https://shiny.rstudio.com) is a powerful R package to display and interact with data (e.g. visualisation of raw data, statistics, geographic information system, ...). The Galaxy Interactive Environment (GIE) feature allows to run Shiny inside of Galaxy, isolated within Docker containers. Several projects are currently interested in embracing and enhancing Shiny-IEs: Galaxy-E (ELIXIR-FR) for ecology and Workflow4Metabolomics (ELIXIR-FR) for metabolomics research. Additionally a GIE for RStudio exists providing an environment for developing R code, integration between these two GIEs could provide an enhanced workflow for developing novel Shiny GIEs within Galaxy.


## Expected outcomes
---

Improvement in the integration of RShiny and RStudio  within the Galaxy framework:. 
 - From the administrator point-of-view by improving the documentation and by ease the installation steps
 - Allow a better flexibility between the Galaxy framework and the GIE: working with multiple datasets and/or dataset collections
Solve some participants problems during some Bring Your Own Issues sessions

## Expected audience
---

Developers and DevOps
Skills needed (and/or):
 - Galaxy Framework
 - Container technologies: Docker or Singularity
 - R, RShiny
 - D3.js, Plotly
 - Nginx, NodeJS
**Expected hacking days**: 3 days, 2 days
