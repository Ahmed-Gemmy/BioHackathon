## Background information
---
Orphanet is a website dedicated to rare diseases, providing several kind of information such nomenclature, classifications, textual information, disorders/genes relations and also dedicated resources in the field (Experts centres, Diagnostic tests, clinical trials, orphandrugs, registries and biobanks, supports groups etc.) for more than 40 countries. 
The site has a huge audience, around 1 million unique visitors/month and 8 languages. Orphanet produce also the Orphanet Rare Diseases Ontology and clinical description of diseases using HPO ontology. Each disease concept has a unique, stable, identifier (Orphacode) which could be used to identify diseases in health information system. The orphacode has been integrated in several countries.


## Expected outcomes
---

Orphanet provides for around 3000 described diseases more than 60000 diseases/HPO annotations curated by experts.
The aim of this proposal, by using several toolkits, will help us to try to: 
1) speed-up the process of annotation with Orphanet textual information / or pubmed publication as input.
2) improve the curation process by comparaison between the automated recognition and the annotations already provided by Orphanet.

## Expected audience
---

programmers, ontologists- Python, Web API - XML, JSON, RDF files formats.  
**Expected hacking days**: 4 days
