## Background information
---
Keeping up with the constant flow of new articles being published in various Journals is a challenge. Recent mitigation techniques, such as twitter and email notifications, address this problem but still require complex efforts and non-trivial filtering and selection queries in order to be useful.
We try to ease this burden by providing a system to continuously analyses new articles while leveraging smart queries using BioSchemas, CSPARQL and BioRxiv as the underlying data source.

## Expected outcomes
---

1) A service that monitors the BioRxiv twitter feed and continuously parses relevant metainformation into easily machine-readable BioSchemas.

2) A notification system with a powerful query-language to perform complex pattern matching and thus focusing the user on the most relevant subset of topics within the stream of publications.

## Expected audience
---

programmers (Java, Javascript, Nodejs, RDF), domain expert (query language design)
**Expected hacking days**: 5 days
