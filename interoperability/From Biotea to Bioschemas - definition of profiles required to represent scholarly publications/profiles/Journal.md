[PublicationIssue](https://schema.org/PublicationIssue) which is a collection of/[schema:hasPart](https://schema.org/hasPart) 
[ScholarlyArticle](https://schema.org/ScholarlyArticle). We have chosen to use Dataset as the seed for our Journal profile 
(it extends [CreativeWork](https://schema.org/CreativeWork) and includes the propery [issn](https://schema.org/issn) which 
is commonly used by Journals).

Please get familiar with [Biotea model](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AYKXrowHpsF9cstn0FeJhpbgfi9T_MeC), 
then get familiar with [schema:Dataset](https://schema.org/Dataset), and then copy and use the [template provided by Bioshemas](#) 
in order to choose you minimum, recommended and optional properties with cardinalities and suggestions on controlled vocabularies. 
Once you are happy with it, please upload it to [Journal files folder](https://github.com/elixir-europe/BioHackathon/tree/master/interoperability/From%20Biotea%20to%20Bioschemas%20-%20definition%20of%20profiles%20required%20to%20represent%20scholarly%20publications/profiles/journalFiles), 
use your name as part of the file name to avoid overlapping.
