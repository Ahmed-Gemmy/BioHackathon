# Biotea mapping to schema.org and Bioschemas

[Biotea](https://peerj.com/articles/4201/) aims to provide structured data for scholarly publications. A pre-mapping to schema.org and Bioschemas has been started already, [please see documents here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AYKXrowHpsF9cstn0FeJhpbgfi9T_MeC).

In [Bioschemas](http://bioschemas.org), we aim to have no more than 6 mimimum properties, no more than 6 recommended properties and no more than 6 optional properties. Plus cardinalities, ONE or MANY, and suggestions on possible controlled vocabularies that could be used.
