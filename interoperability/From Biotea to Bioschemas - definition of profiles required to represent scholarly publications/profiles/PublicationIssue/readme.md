A [PublicationIssue](https://schema.org/PublicationIssue) [is part of](https://schema.org/isPartOf) a [PublicationVolume](https://schema.org/PublicationVolume) and comprises collection of (i.e., [schema:hasPart](https://schema.org/hasPart)) 
[ScholarlyArticle](https://schema.org/ScholarlyArticle). Please bear in mind that sometimes you can go from Journal directly to PublicationIssue without passing by a PublicationVolume. Meaning that all these paths are possible:
* Journal -> ScholarlyArticle
* Journal -> PublicationIssue -> ScholarlyArticle
* Journal -> PublicationVolumne -> ScholarlyArticle
* Journal -> PublicationVolume -> PublicationIssue -> ScholarlyArticle
