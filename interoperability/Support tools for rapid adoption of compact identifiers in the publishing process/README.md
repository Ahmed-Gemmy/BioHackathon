## Background information
---
This project builds on the Elixir Identifiers implementation study and aims to boost adoption of Compact Identifiers in the publishing process through the development of lightweight tools for efficient integration into third party websites. 

The Identifiers.org registry contains hundreds of manually curated, high quality data collections, with each assigned a unique prefix. The Identifiers.org resolver provides a stable resolution service for these Compact Identifiers.

This new approach has been presented in a recent paper in Nature-Scientific Data [1]. Identifiers.org is already working with Nature Scientific Data which will implement this new standard in their editorial practice [2].

## Expected outcomes
---

The outcome of this project will be a fast lightweight javascript library/widget for creating, validating, resolving and embedding Compact Identifiers, which can easily be integrated with third party web applications.

## Expected audience
---

This project is expected to attract the attention of the bioinformatics community who are interested in working with Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, Java, Python, Django, Shell Script, Kubernetes and AWS.
**Expected hacking days**: 4 days
