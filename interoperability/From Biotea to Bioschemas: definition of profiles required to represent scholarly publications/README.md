## Background information
---
Biotea [1] provides a way to model biomedical scholarly publications in RDF, taking into account metadata, references, content and biomedical annotations. Bioschemas provides a simple way to add structured data to web pages. Mapping Biotea to Bioschemas represents an opportunity to easily add a semantic layer to publications, making them FAIRer and more machine-consumable. Having scholarly data in Bioschemas opens up possibilities for smarter recommendation systems and literature-based knowledge graphs and discovery.

## Expected outcomes
---

* Draft specification for scholarly publication Bioschemas profiles such as Journal, ScholarlyArticle and Author 
* Brainstorm on how to integrate the Biotea annotations model to Bioschemas 
* Story cases on how such data can be consumed and integrated to existing tools (e.g., [2])

## Expected audience
---

People interested in scholarly publications, Bioschemas, structured data, natural language processing.
**Expected hacking days**: 4 days
