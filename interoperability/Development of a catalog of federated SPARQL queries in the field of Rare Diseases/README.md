## Background information
---
Orphanet is a website dedicated to rare diseases, providing several kind of information such nomenclature, classifications, textual information, disorders/genes relations and also dedicated resources in the field (Experts centres, Diagnostic tests, clinical trials, orphandrugs, registries and biobanks, supports groups etc.) for more than 40 countries. 
The site has a huge audience, around 1 million unique visitors/month and 8 languages. Orphanet produce also the Orphanet Rare Diseases Ontology and clinical description of diseases using HPO ontology. Each disease concept has a unique, stable, identifier (Orphacode) which could be used to identify diseases in health information system. The orphacode has been integrated in several countries.


## Expected outcomes
---

Orphanet provides an ontology (ORDO) for rare diseases and also an ontological module (HOOM) to disseminate phenotypic information based on HPO. ORDO+HOOM are available with a blazegraph docker image and also a sparql endpoint. We will try to leverage the knowledge of RD by the uses of accessible sparql endpoint (EBI, wikidata, wikipathway, bio2rdf etc.) and provides a catalogue of relevant federated sparql queries

## Expected audience
---

programmes, ontologists : python, java, RDF/OWL, Sparql
**Expected hacking days**: 3 days
