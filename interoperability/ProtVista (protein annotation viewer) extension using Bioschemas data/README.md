## Background information
---
Back in the days, the Distributed Annotation Protocol (DAS) provided protein annotation from multiple resources in a uniform format. Such data was fed to DASTY, a protein annotation viewer that could be embedded on any website. DASTY was used in UniProt to display annotations coming from other data resources. Bioschemas can take place of DAS as it provides a specification for marking up protein annotations on web pages. As for the visualization, ProtVista provides a highly modular, reusable and extensible set of web components to visualize protein annotation. Sources not fully compliant with the data model are supported via adapters. We propose to combine Bioschemas data with ProtVista in order to support protein annotation visualization.

## Expected outcomes
---

* ProtVista adapter to use Bioschemas data
* ProtVista extension to display Bioschemas protein annotations from multiple sources
* Integration with BioJS


## Expected audience
---

People interested in
* Bioschemas
* Visualization, BioJS
* Web components
* Protein annotations
**Expected hacking days**: 4 days
