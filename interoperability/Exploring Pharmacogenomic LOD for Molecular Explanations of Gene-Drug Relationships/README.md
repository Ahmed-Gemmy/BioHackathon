## Background information
---
The idea of the hacking task is to find elements of mechanistic/molecular explanations of pharmacogenomic (PGx) drug-gene relationships present in our PGx Linked Data set, named PGxLOD (https://pgxlod.loria.fr/). 
Proposing molecular explanation can be seen as predicting novel links between a drug and a target protein, or between a drug and a gene to a same unique pathway. 
We consider these links as interpretation elements to experts who wonder why a gene impacts a drug response. 
This may include enriching of our initial linked data, adding provenance elements and experimenting link prediction methods (or others).

## Expected outcomes
---

1/ Enrichment and reuse of our Pharmacogenomic LOD
2/ Getting our Pharmacogenomic LOD more FAIR
3/ Learning from the Elixir network experience
4/ Developing network for future projects at the interface between bioinformatics and medical informatics
5/ Networking for our PhD students and postdocs

## Expected audience
---

Python programmers, RDF fans, FAIR evangelists, AI enthousiasts
