## Background information
---
Blockchain is a collection of technologies (cryptographic security, decentralization, digital registry, smart contracts, rules and incentives to collaborate among institutions with different levels of trust) that is currently being tested in different industries and organizations (financial, government, shipping,...). In the context of OpenScience blockchain provides provenance, transparency, availability, and replicability. Our hacking proposal reuses blockchain tech, Hyperledger in particular, to manage samples in the biomedical domain. We are currently looking at BioSamples as a system that stores and supplies descriptions and metadata about biological samples for industry and academica. The system can be augmented in order to track not only the samples through a workflow but also the protocols that create the samples. That is a Software-as-a-Service version of LIMS (laboratory information managemet system). In addition, having a blockchain for BioSamples will also make it possible to establish a reward mechanisms that incentivises the creation & curation of samples, so helping to drive improved trust and reputation.

## Expected outcomes
---

- Identify the added value of Blockchain technologies on BioSamples and similar sample management tools.
- Create a business case (PoC) implemented on Hyperledger Composer that includes the data standards and current functionalities of BioSamples.
- Extend BioSamples to include Protocols.
- High-level design of the (Fabric) network that will support the business case. Define a roadmap so that deployment over Hyperledger Fabric is achievable within the next months. 

Our code will also contribute to the https://github.com/Blockchain4openscience/sample-networks project. We also expect to start the discussion about using blockchain technology for keeping the trail of evidence in the annotation process.  

## Expected audience
---

Bioinformaticians, chemoinformaticians, data scientists, researchers with some programming skills and wet-lab researchers who can provide the context for the problem and can lead the programmers into a useful solution. Participants should have minimal knowledge of JSON and Javascript (ideally Angular). Researchers working with identifiers and also people involved in [BioSamples](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/). During the first day of hacking there will be a tutorial on Blockchain technologies and Hyperledger Composer for participants and open to all others that are interested. 

**Expected hacking days**: 4 days

### Tasks (days)

1. Tutorial on Blockchain technologies and Hyperledger Composer. Evaluationg how would BioSamples benefit from blockchain technologies.  
2. Designing a distributed ledger for BioSamples and similar sample management tools for deployment in Hyperledger Fabric. Designing and implementing a business network application on Hyperledger Composer for the project.
3. Usability of the ledger, designing front-end and extensions to other complmentary digital assets (protocols, laboratory notebooks).
4. Documenting (GitHub repo) and writting-up a presentation for the project.
