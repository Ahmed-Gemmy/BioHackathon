## Background information
---
Blockchain technology has proven to be useful in the financial industry as the ledger for cryptocurrencies. Similarly, blockchain has been successfully used in identity management. Our hacking proposal reuses blockchain tech, hyperledger in particular, to manage identifiers, e.g. samples, instruments, reagents, etc, in the biomedical domain. Keeping identifiers in the blockchain will make it possible for the biomedical domain to keep track of items, identifiers, identified objects, history of the identifier and trace of provenance. In addition, having a blockchain for identifiers will also make it possible to establish a reward mechanisms that incentivises the creation & use of identifiers so helping to drive improved trust and reputation.

## Expected outcomes
---

We expect to get the business case implemented in Hyperledger Composer as a PoC. We also expect to define a roadmap so that deployment over Hyperledger Fabric is achievable within the next 3 months. Our main outcome, code, will be generic; our code will also contribute to the https://github.com/Blockchain4openscience/sample-networks project. We also expect to start the discussion about using blockchain technology for keeping the trail of evidence in the annotation process.  

## Expected audience
---

Bioinformaticians, chemoinformaticians, data scientists, researchers with some programming skills and wet-lab researchers who can provide the context for the problem and can lead the programmers into a useful solution. Software developers with and without experience in Hyperledger and Blockchain technology. Participants should have minimal knowledge of JSON and Javascript (ideally Angular). Researchers working with identifiers and also people involved in identifiers.org 
**Expected hacking days**: 4 days
