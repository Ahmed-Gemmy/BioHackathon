## Background information
---
DBCLS has contributed to developing RDF-based data models and tools collaborating with biomedical researchers. Recent activities include construction of Med2RDF datasets and collaboration on BioSamples with EBI. Cross-institutional application of these models is important toward interoperable use of distributed biomedical resources. In addition to the data modeling, we have contributed to providing datasets as NBDC RDF portal service, which will be useful as a data integration platform. For effective use of RDF databases, we have developed Semantic Web tools, including LOD Surfer, SPANG, SPARQList, and TogoStanza. Application of these tools should be addressed for enhancing interoperable use of distributed biomedical resources.

## Expected outcomes
---

- Development of applications using Med2RDF datasets
- Interoperable use case of BioSamples model
- Use case of NBDC RDF portal as FAIR data
- Application of LOD Surfer
- Application of SPANG
- Application of SPARQList
- Application of TogoStanza

## Expected audience
---

Developers using RDF/SPARQL/JavaScript, ontologists, biomedical researchers

**Expected hacking days**: 4 days
