## Background information
---
Drug discovery pipelines are immensely expensive in time and resources, which are wasted if a drug is rejected due to toxicities discovered in late stages. Better pathway effect prediction tools would enable scientists to qualify protein targets in early stages with more confidence, resulting in higher success rates. Using UniProt, HPO, pathway, protein interaction data and more, we will explore mapping and integration approaches to build a "queryable" structure (dataset, knowledge network,..)  of these data. This will help create tools for scientists to better understand effects of drugs on potential protein targets in multiple pathways.

## Expected outcomes
---

Outcomes include:
- Understanding the data involved
- Mapping and connecting data to create a network
- Enable exploration of network via querying/visualisation
- Identifying scenarios of pathways being affected by the chosen target

## Expected audience
---

Data Scientists, Bioinformaticians or programmers interested in proteins data and pathways, drug discovery scientists/ systems biologists.
**Expected hacking days**: 4 days

## Technologies and tools
---

Apache Spark, Apache Zeppelin, GraphFrame, Neo4j
