## Background information
---
Galaxy is an open-source web framework for easy-to-use, reproducible and shareable computational life science research, with >100 public Galaxy servers. Training is an integral part of the Galaxy community. In collaboration with GOBLET and the ELIXIR Training Platform, the Galaxy Training Network is developing open, peer-reviewed and FAIR training material: >80 tutorials developed by >60 contributors, available at https://training.galaxyproject.org, to deliver training for scientists, developers and system administrators. The material is complemented by metadata to automatically populate the ELIXIR training portal (TeSS) and to describe the technical infrastructure needed to run the tutorial (e.g. tools, data, workflows, etc.).

## Expected outcomes
---

Following the success of previous hackathons, we propose the organisation of a workshop to further pursue some of the objectives of the ELIXIR Galaxy Use case for training, e.g.:
- Improve and extend the collection of Galaxy training materials 
- Add support for BioSchemas
- Plan internationalisation and localisation support in order to make the training material available to users in their own language
- Complete the integration with the new TeSS workflow annotator
- Automatic workflow testing


## Expected audience
---

Instructors and anyone eager to develop Galaxy-related training material. No specific knowledge or skills are required, just motivation!
**Expected hacking days**: 4 days, 3 days, 2 days
