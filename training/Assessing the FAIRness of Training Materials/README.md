## Background information
---
The FAIR metrics working group (http://fairmetrics.org) developed the framework and defined the exemplar metrics for measuring FAIRness of digital resources [2]. FAIRness reflects the extent to which a digital resource addresses the FAIR principles as per the expectations defined by a community. So far there has been no work done on establishing those expectations and assessing the fairness  of Training resources (learning materials and events). First discussions have sparkled during ELIXIR All Hands 2018 meeting a group of people participated in the workshop “How to make training FAIR” [3]. During this workshop a small team has been defined as a working group on FAIR metrics for training.

## Expected outcomes
---

We expect to first identify community expectations of training materials, second catalogue new  training-specific metrics, third perform a FAIRness assessment of existing training materials with existing and new metrics, and fourth evaluate how Bioschemas TrainingMaterial specification works regarding the identified metrics. This work aim to complement efforts started by FAIR metrics group (see references 1 and 2).

## Expected audience
---

* Training coordinators
* Trainers
* Trainees
* Anyone interested in or with knowledge on FAIR principles and passionate about training  
**Expected hacking days**: 2-4 days

## Tentative tasks
---
Not sure how long we will get during the Paris BioHackathon, but some ideas here
1. Brainstorming on what FAIR means for training materials
2. Brainstorming on how to assess FAIRness for training materials
3. Brainstorming on challenges and how to deal with them
4. Brainstorming on metrics to assess FAIRness for training materials
5. Some agreements and plan on how to follow

## How to participate
---
* There has been some brainstorming already on going as part of Elixir activities on the Training Platform. Please have a look to the content of this project space (right here where you are) and go through the available documents to get familiar with summaries of previous discussions
* Join us to brainstorming
* If you cannot join the live brainstorming, still keep an eye to this space and share your comments or doubts via GitHub issues, please use the label "project: FAIR training"

Thanks for collaborating!
