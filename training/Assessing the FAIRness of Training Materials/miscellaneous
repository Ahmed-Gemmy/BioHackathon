# Training material definition

Any resource that is used for training purposes, e.g., datasets, slides or videos.

# Goals by adding FAIR to training materials

* Make training materials reusable. By reusable we mean that someone else other than the initial creator can get the training 
material data and metadata in order to replicate the training activity. We suppose a similar/compatible/equivalent set of skills 
required to replicate the training activity supported by FAIR training materials.
